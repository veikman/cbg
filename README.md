## CBG: a Card-Based Game creation library

CBG is a toolkit for writing programs that transform human-readable
specifications for novel playing cards into SVG graphics. These graphics
can then be printed and used in tabletop games and similar activities.

CBG is intended primarily for game designers with programming skills.
Apart from making new games, the library is also useful for simple
handouts, such as memos on the dramatis personae of an RPG campaign,
and for "resurrecting" games long out of print.


### Usage

The library API should be considered unstable. There is no manual.

For installation instructions, refer to the included scripts.

An example implementation is provided in another repository, where CBG
is used to generate a [planning poker](https://github.com/veikman/ppoker) deck.
