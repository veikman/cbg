## CBG: a Card-Based Game creation library

CBG is a toolkit for writing programs that transform human-readable
specifications for novel playing cards into SVG graphics. These graphics
can then be printed and used in tabletop games and similar activities.

CBG is intended primarily for game designers with programming skills.
Apart from making new games, the library is also useful for simple
handouts, such as memos on the dramatis personae of an RPG campaign,
and for "resurrecting" games long out of print.


### Installation

CBG is a regular Python 3 package. Refer to the included scripts.


### Usage

By default, CBG produces SVG graphics scaled to A4 pages, with measurements
treated as millimetres, despite the scale-free nature of SVG.

An example implementation is provided in another repository, where CBG
is used to generate a [planning poker](https://github.com/veikman/ppoker) deck.

The library API should be considered unstable. There is no manual.
