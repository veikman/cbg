CBG: a Card-Based Game creation library
=======================================

CBG is a toolkit for writing programs that transform human-readable
specifications for novel playing cards into SVG graphics. These graphics
can then be printed and used in tabletop games.

CBG is intended primarily for tabletop game designers and publishers, with
programming skills. Apart from making new games, the library is also useful
for simple handouts, such as memos on the dramatis personae of an RPG
campaign, and for "resurrecting" games long out of print.

The library API should be considered unstable. There is no manual.

For installation instructions, refer to the included scripts.
